    "To tune the learning rate hyperparameter, and any others for that matter, a selection of values should be tried and whichever yields the best validation loss should be kept. It is not practical or efficient to test every possible value so a common strategy in the literature is to test powers of 10 e.g. 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common approach is to allow the learning rate to be decreased during the training process. This means that earlier steps can make larger movements but as the model converges, the learning rate gets smaller so small steps can me made to avoid overshooting the minimum. One way of implementing this is to use a learning rate scheduler to reduce the rate after a certain number of epochs, though it can be difficult to determine at which epochs the rate should be reudced. An alternative is to reduce the learning rate whenever the loss doesnt improve for a certain amount of time.\n",

    "The `RMSProp` optimiser i'm using also has a `momentum` parameter. This essentially allows gradient descent to build up speed and can help pass local minima or saddle points. RMSProp also includes a dampening factor, `rho` which helps slow the process to avoid overshooting the minimum."
